We are a family of four: 

Lisa, my lovely wife, passionate for God, people and her family

Elia Leon (born 2005), the "arty", lighthearted, thinking out loud, passionate guy, 

Luca Samuel (born 2007), the more introvert down to earth, cool, strong, deep thinker

Wolfgang, the older guy who constantly wonders why God constantly has the better plan in store
